## TRAVEL APP (UNFINISHED)

### Project objectives

This project is a travel-related application built using React Native. The goal of the project is to further my understanding of this programming language. Although the project remains unfinished, it has already helped me learn more about mobile app development, integrating UI components, and working with data from APIs.
